Thanks for purchasing this pakage, I hope you are going to have as much fun building your levels,
as I had compiling this package. 

Take a quick tour through all the prefabs, I have only used a small portion of what you have just purchased,
so taking a quick browse, is going to make you even happier about your purchase, plus,
place a reminder to what buildingblocks you have at your disposal.

The purpose of the largse selection of variations is so that two areas does not have to be exactly the same
even if the dsign and layout is the same and another.


NB!!!            ***  Please could you rate and possibly review the package  ***
It really assist others in making informed purchases when spending there hard earned money :)



v1.9 --- Modern Electric UPDATE ---


After the very successfull "From the Sewers it Came" campaign on the Unity Asset Store
I wanted to give a small present to all the people that had purchased during the SALE and before.

I added an extra texture sheet with a bunch of more currentday type meshes & prefabs

These new prefabs can be found in the follorwing directory

3DForge\TaD\SewerKit\Prefabs\Electric

 - Assortment of Electrical Boxes
 - Assortment of Cables from small to large items
 - Assortment of electrical lights in blue, red, green, yellow & white
 - Assortment of nice thin Steel ralings to be more current day type style

Meshes 71
Prefabs 102
Particles 4 (Insects)


                 ************


v1.8.1 --- Deeper Down - FLOOR UPDATE ---

I had user requests that asked what can be done about the clean smooth floors.

Solution was to use the already included
Assets\3DForge\TaD\SewerKit\Prefabs\Ruined\Rubble\ ... tiles was used and distributed all over
at random to give an even rougher rundown look that suits the rugged look.

The Empty game object that contains all those newly placed items is FLOOR TILES,
meaning if you dont want it, then easy, just hide or delete that object that contains them.
These dont have coliders so that they have no inflence on movement across them and purely cosmetic.

The Deeper Down live Web Demo can be viewed to see this updates scene baked and in action


                 ************


v1.8 --- Deeper Down - FPS UPDATE ---

I added a large selection of FPS optimized meshed and prefabs enabling the users to build cool
levels and game scenes using the vertical space as well,
so that rooms and passges can be above and below adding so many more interesting options.

333 new meshes
450 new prefabs

Most sits in the Assets\3DForge\TaD\SewerKit\Prefabs\FPS directory

For those who already own the package and want to see the new parts
They can 100% be used for Top Down as well (just hide the roofs or use the prefabs that dont have them included)
they do have more polygons, so if that is a concern, then use the other ones in the tiles section.


                 ************


v1.7 --- Thief's Guild Top Down Demo ---

This is a fullfillment of user requested to add an example of the Top Down Demo Scene.


                 ************


v1.6 --- Straight Ralings added ---

This is a fullfillment of user requested meshes and pre-fabs addition that adds 2m, 4m, 6m, 8m & 10m straight railings
to the existing ralings folder.

Sew_Rail_Wooden_2
Sew_Rail_Wooden_4
Sew_Rail_Wooden_6
Sew_Rail_Wooden_8
Sew_Rail_Wooden_10


                 ************


v1.5 --- Large Open Area Tiles ---

This is a fullfillment of user requested meshes and pre-fabs addition that will enable the building of large open areas.

I have added 6m x 6m & 10m x 10m tile meshes and Pre-fabs to
/2m Canal
/6m Canal
/Base Tiles
for each of the the two groups

These new tiles all contain the word "basic" in them.
A second version of each was also added that includes the matching roof pre-fabs for FPS gameplay usage

NB!!! Look at DEMO Scene Walkway Area walls to see small pillars used to plug the open corners that could appear when using these tiles.
This is one of many items that can be used to plug the hole.


                 ************


v1.4 --- Arches and Doors ---

This is a fullfillment of user requested meshes and pre-fabs addition.

I have added the Keystones, Completed arches as well as a few stronger looking doors and doors that match these completed arches
The Keystone piece can easily be daade to other parts using vertice snapping to click it into it's place


                 ************


v1.3 --- And Let the Roofs be complete ---

I Have added roof prefabs to all the 6m x 6m tiles.
The tiles each have a version witout and a version with the roof prefab added inside of it.
The ones without are for Top-Down use
If you want to test both, but with the same layout and not doing the work twice,
then build with the tiles that include the roofs for the FPS scene, then " Save Scene As " and give it a new name.
On this duplicate scene, just go into each tile prefab, and delete the roof prefab inside each tile prefab.

* Special Note *

Please check on FPS demo and have a look at the black blocking strips that were used. (prefab can be found in toolbox)
Bottom/Underneath, non visable polygons were culled for Top-Down use of the tile to reduce geometry that loads
Through these hole, unwanted snippets might appear.
Add these black surfaces with the normal facing the playing area.
Make one with the required height, and just duplicate, it goed quite fast once the first few are made

It is stated next to the 6m tiles that they are for mobile.
If peformance start to suffer, use the tiles without the roofs and just adjust the background colour setting on your camera to black.

v1.2 --- And Let there be Roofs ---

I Have added roof prefabs to all the 10m x 10m tiles.
The tiles each have a version witout and a version with the roof prefab added inside of it.

The main concept behind the Larger Tiles is that you can quicker and easier build large section without placing 100's of tiles,
together with only one texture to load you should get very low drawcalls for Mobile as well as Desktop.


Mobile & Desktop:
I have seperated the groups with the 6m x 6m tiles labled as Mobile and the 10m x 10m tiles as PC
There is no stopping you using either one for the other platform. The smaller tiles just have less geometry that loads into memory.
There are soo many configurations of PC's and tablets these days, that it is not a hard and fast rule laid in stone.
I also felt that the users would appreciate getting both the tile sets in one purchased package instead of two seperate ones.


For optimization I have culled all polygons that are not visable, to lower the resourse usage further.

Also, all the screenshots and DEMOS that you have seen has been achieved with a Diffuse map only,
so no special shaders are required that to make your game look great and save you further system resources.


The scene that was used for the online DEMOS and the screenshots are included in this package,
as well as a never before seen basic scene to provide an example of the walkway tile usage
to build underground walkways across large water bodies, it is quick, easy, and fun.


There is a 6m x 6m tile set as well as a 10m x 10m tile set:
I have constructed a wide selection of possible tile designs to assist in building the largest possible selection scenes.

Should you encounter an area that you need that extra special tile that I have not included,
then you can construct it out of the spare parts that I have placed in the following directory under prefabs
... \3DForge\TaD\SewerKit\Prefabs\SewerKit Toolbox
If you feel that this tile design needs to be made as another single mesh and prefab,
and would like to see it become part of the pack for others even to enjoy,
then please email me a couple of screenshots as you have combined it out of smaller parts
and if it suits the overall look at feel of the pack I will include it in future updates.


There is a good selection of variations of items, sometimes with pillars on ends and then also without,
that is so you have option to use when there would have been a Z-fighting problem if only one set was included


NB:
Using the MeshCombine function via code or the SimpleMeshCobine tool on the asset store alone or in combination with Batching
you will experience great joy to see the draw calls drop tremendously.
The largest drawcalls taker in my experience are lights, switch them off,
Meshcombine the whole dungoen and you will have only a few Draw calls on your plate,
so use them carefully, you could also use two different colured directional lights from two different angles to create atmospheric scenes.
Set the ambient light a bit higher and yu would require less light sources.


Doors and gates:
The door items have been exported with the Y Axis being the rotational axis.
This will enable you to have them open and close easily with code.


Vertice-Snap is your freind:
Because the tile are completely modular, a tile editor such as Tile Ed would assit in building levels.
But because the tiles are large and you would place not that many manual placment is done with eaze.
For those who don't know, holding down "V" while useing the move function will have the object you have selected
snap to the closest neigbouring object's vertices enabling you to click the tiles together in a matter of seconds.

ProGrids 2:
Using 1.0 as a setting would have it work in all three axis

Once you have picked up on all the small trick you won't want to go without it.

PS !!! Many meshes have single polygons left in strategic spots; bittom middle, end middel and so forth of items.
Use these as handles to snap them onto the desired spots in your level, it will make them much easier to acurately place.


Colliders have already been added to most of the geometry which will save you hours of work,
so, what you waiting for, dive in and build some cool levels for your next poject.

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website
